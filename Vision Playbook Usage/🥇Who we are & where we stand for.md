# VALUES

## 1. KNOWLEDGEABLE
We believe that gaining and sharing knowledge across boundaries is the foundation of innovation. Openness is essential, and knowledge-sharing is the core pillar of our organization. For us, lifelong learning is not just a phrase, it’s an everyday practice that drives our success.

### How we live this value:
- Monthly internal knowledge-sharing sessions
- Annual 5-week knowledge bootcamp
- Strategic partnerships with Microsoft & Databricks
- Personalized growth plans for every employee
- Open sharing of knowledge across teams
- Founders of Fabric Belgium initiative
- Community ambassadors fostering external collaboration

## 2. 360° FEEDBACK
We practice radical candor: feedback that’s direct yet kind, accountability without blame. We view feedback as a continuous opportunity for growth, embedded in our daily routines. Every employee is paired with a coach, who supports them in achieving both long- and short-term goals. If career paths shift, we adapt to ensure ongoing support. Feedback is more than a two-way street—between coach and employee, and across internal and external teams.

### How we live this value:
- Every employee has a dedicated coach
- Fixed 360-degree feedback sessions twice a year to align on goals
- Feedback goes in all directions—coach to employee, employee to coach, and peer-to-peer

## 3. FREEDOM & ACCOUNTABILITY
We trust our top talent to handle autonomy with responsibility. Employees have the freedom to manage their schedules and projects while remaining accountable for delivering results and meeting customer expectations. Authority is decentralized to empower people and teams, encouraging agility and ownership.

### How we live this value:
- No need for holiday approval from HR; employees coordinate directly with clients
- Autonomous, self-managed teams with decentralized decision-making as we grow

## 4. INNOVATION & EXPERIMENTATION
We cultivate an environment where experimentation is encouraged and embraced. We see mistakes as learning opportunities, and we celebrate both success and failure. If you have an idea, pitch it. We’ll give honest feedback, and if you believe in it, we’ll support you in bringing it to life.

### How we live this value:
- Every employee has access to a €1,000 yearly experimentation budget to explore new technologies, software, or project ideas that enhance innovation or efficiency
