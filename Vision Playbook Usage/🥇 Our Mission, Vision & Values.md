## Our Story: The Birth of a Vision üöÄ

Plainsight was born out of a simple yet powerful idea: to create a company where innovation thrives, and people are empowered to turn ideas into reality. Our journey began in 2023, when a group of passionate individuals, driven by a shared vision, decided to challenge the status quo in the Data & AI Industry. They saw a gap, an opportunity to make a difference, and they seized it with both hands.

The early days were filled with late nights, tough decisions, and relentless perseverance. But it was also a time of excitement and discovery. We built our foundation on the belief that with the right mix of talent, technology, and teamwork, anything is possible.
