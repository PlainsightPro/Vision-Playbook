## The Hiring Journey 🚀

### 1. Initial Contact: Making the Connection 🤝
Our journey together begins the moment you express interest in joining Plainsight. Whether you applied directly or were scouted by our talent team, we’ll reach out to set up an initial conversation. This is our chance to get to know you, understand your career goals, and see how they align with our vision.

### 2. The Screening Process: Let’s Dive Deeper 🔍
If the initial vibe is good, we'll invite you to one of our offices for a deeper conversation, a technical test and a tour at the office. 

#### Face-to-Face meeting (+-30min)
In this stage, we’ll review your experience, skills, and potential fit with our team. This might is an in-person interview at one of our offices where we discuss your past projects, your approach to problem-solving, and how you could contribute to Plainsight’s mission. We’ll also answer any questions you have about the role, our culture, or our expectations.

#### Showcasing Your Skills 🛠️ (+-45min)
Depending on the role, you might be asked to complete an assessment or case study that simulates the kind of work you’d be doing at Plainsight. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your expertise and for us to see how you approach challenges in a practical context.

- 🧘 **Relax**: No prep needed—just bring your own laptop with a Google account, and we'll explain everything on the spot.
### 3. The Interview Rounds: Meeting the Team 💼
Next, you’ll have the opportunity to meet with various members of our team, including potential colleagues and leaders. These interviews are as much about us getting to know you as they are about you learning more about us. We value open, two-way conversations where both sides can explore if there’s a mutual fit.

### 4. The Offer: Welcome to the Plainsight Team 🎉
If everything aligns, we’ll extend a formal offer for you to join the team. This offer will include details on your role, compensation, benefits, and any other relevant information. We believe in being transparent and fair, so we’ll take the time to go over the offer with you and answer any questions. If one of both parties doesn't feel an exact fit, feel free to ask or give feedback - feedback is in our DNA.

Once you're happy with the offer, it's time to accept and get ready to join us!

Not selected? Don't hold back to ask for feedback: it's in our DNA. 

## Preparing for Your First Day 🌱

Once you’ve accepted the offer, the pre-boarding process officially begins. We’ll provide you with all the information you need to hit the ground running on your first day. 🏃‍➡️ This includes access to our onboarding portal, where you can complete necessary paperwork, learn more about our culture, and start getting acquainted with your team.

We’ll also pair you with a buddy who will be your go-to person for any questions or support you need as you settle in. Our goal is to make you feel welcomed and prepared from day one.
