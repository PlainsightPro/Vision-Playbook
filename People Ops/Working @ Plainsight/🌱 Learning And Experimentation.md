# Learning and Experimentation 🌱

At Plainsight, we believe in continuous learning and fostering a culture of experimentation. Here’s how we support your growth and innovation:

## Experimentation Budget 💸

At Plainsight, we know that the best ideas often come from a little experimentation. That’s why we provide an experimentation budget! Use this budget to buy books, access subscriptions (like DataCamp, EdX, ChatGPT, etc.), or even buy a Raspberry Pi. As long as it contributes to your personal growth and our collective knowledge, the sky’s the limit!

## External Training 🚀

### Personal-Led Training
Looking to deepen your expertise? You can request external training tailored to your personal and professional development needs. Whether it’s a workshop, certification, or course, your career coach is here to help you make it happen. Let’s grow together!

## Azure Playground ☁️

### Company-Wide Sandboxing
We offer a company-wide sandboxing subscription in Azure, where every team member is an owner. This shared environment allows you to experiment and learn together. Please make sure to tag your resource group so we can link it to you. This is a fantastic way to try new things without worrying about the impact on production environments.

### Personal Sandboxing
Want more control? You can request a personal Azure subscription with a $150 monthly budget through a Visual Studio Enterprise license. This personal sandbox gives you the freedom to explore and innovate on your terms. Just reach out to your career coach to set it up!
