# 🌴Holidays 

> *"Take them, enjoy them 200%, and come back with amazing stories! 🌴🏖️"*

We believe in the importance of taking time off to relax, recharge, and come back ready to tackle new challenges. Here's all you need to know about your holidays.

## 🗓️ Your Holiday Entitlement

- **20 Legal Holidays** 
- **12 Additional ADV Days**
- **{optional}: Youth holidays**
	- General information can be found here: [RVA youth holidays](https://www.rva.be/burgers/verlof/hebt-u-recht-op-de-jeugdvakantie)
	- If you have some legal holidays, **you must take up these first**
	- For Youth holidays fill in "form C103", to be downloaded from the [RVA website](https://www.rva.be/formulieren-attesten/c103-jeugdvakantie-werknemer) and deliver to your "Hulpkas" (like HVW for instance) **OR**
	- **Easier way if the choice of "hulpkas" doesn't matter**: Follow the steps in this [link](https://full-unemployment.hvw-capac.fgov.be/nl/onboarding/welcome?type=yv)
	- Your days will be added to the Officient Selfservice and you'll be able to use them
	- You get no payment from us for these days, but from the government. After each month you have taken up some youth holidays, the payout will be done within a month (or so they say 😉)
- **{optional}: European holidays**
	- Similar principle as youth holidays, but for people that don't meet the requirements for youth holidays
	- Take into account: you will be paid a normal wage (excl. net allowances), **but** this amount will be subtracted from your double holiday allowance for the next year.
	- More info: [site RJV](https://www.rjv.fgov.be/nl/wat-in-geval-van/herbeginnen-of-aanvullende-vakantie/hoe-genieten-van-de-aanvullende-vakantie)

## 💼 Setting an Out of Office Message

When you're off, set an **Out of Office** message to let others know. Here's an example template:

> "Hi there!  
> I am currently out of the office enjoying my holidays 🌴. I will be back on [Return Date]. Emails will not be read and not be forwarded. I will get back to you as soon as possible after my return.  
> Best regards,  
> [Your Name]"

To set your Out of Office message in Outlook:
1. Go to **File** > **Automatic Replies**.
2. Click on **"Send automatic replies"**.
3. Fill in your message for both internal and external contacts.
4. Set the start and end date/times.
5. **Save** and enjoy your holidays! ✅

Also add your holidays to your **Outlook calendar**. This will sync with Teams and in that way people trying to contact you or plan a meeting with you will immediately see that you're not in.

Take full advantage of your holidays, relax, and come back with great memories to share!
