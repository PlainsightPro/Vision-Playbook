# Offices and Locations üè¢

At Plainsight, we believe that efficiency and impact far outweigh the importance of a specific location. While we have several key locations where our teams frequently meet, you are free to work from other cities or from home, as it suits your customer and you best. Our flexible approach to work environments is designed to foster collaboration, innovation, and a healthy work-life balance.

## Bi-Weekly Coworking Days

We encourage you to join us on our bi-weekly coworking days, which are geographically spread to make participation easier for everyone. These coworking days are a perfect opportunity to work together, share ideas, and maybe even grab lunch or a drink after work! üçª

## Flexibility and Remote Work

The most important part of your work is that it‚Äôs done in a qualitative and timely manner. This means you don‚Äôt need to be present in one of our offices unless it benefits your project or collaboration with others. Efficiency drives results, so feel free to choose the work environment that best suits your needs‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs from one of our offices, a co-working space, or your home.

---

Wherever you choose to work, know that you‚Äôre part of a team that values your contribution and is here to support your growth. Let‚Äôs keep pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible, no matter where we are!
