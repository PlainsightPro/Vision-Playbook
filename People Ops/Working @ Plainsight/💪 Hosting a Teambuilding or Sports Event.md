# Hosting a Teambuilding or Sports Event 🎉🏀

At Plainsight, we love to see our team come together, whether it’s for fun, fitness, or both! Hosting a teambuilding or sports event is a fantastic way to strengthen bonds, promote a healthy lifestyle, and enjoy some downtime with your colleagues.

## Sponsorship Guidelines 💰

- **Reasonable Costs**: If the cost of the event is reasonable and 4 or more people participate, Plainsight is happy to sponsor the event in whatever way it can. 
- **Encouragement, Not Obligation**: While we encourage everyone to organize and join in on these events, there’s no obligation to do so. The goal is to foster a positive environment where everyone feels comfortable and engaged.

## Why Host an Event? 🤔

- **Promote Wellness**: Sports and team activities are a great way to stay active and healthy.
- **Build Stronger Teams**: These events are perfect for boosting morale and strengthening relationships within the team.
- **Have Fun Together**: Most importantly, it’s about having fun and enjoying each other’s company outside of the usual work environment.
