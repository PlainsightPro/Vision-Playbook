# DAX Coding Standards

## Overview
Prioritize readability and maintainability: use `VAR` blocks, format with line breaks/indentation,  
add comments, and prefer **measures** over calculated columns when possible.

## Do’s & Don’ts

**Do**
- Use `VAR` to compute sub-results once and `RETURN` a clear expression. Prefix your variables with an underscore.  
- Format DAX consistently (each argument on a new line, indent filters).  
- Add inline `// comments` for complex business rules.  
- Use `DIVIDE` instead of `/` as `DIVIDE` allows safe handling of divide-by-zero.  
- Use **helper measures** to avoid duplication and simplify maintenance.  
- Use `CALCULATE` only when you need to **change filter context**, otherwise keep logic in base measures.  
- Replace complex `IF` chains with `SWITCH(TRUE(), …)` for readability.  
- Keep **business logic** in measures, not in calculated columns (except when needed for relationships).  
- Test for **blank values** explicitly to avoid misleading 0s in reports.  
- Document assumptions in comments (e.g., “Assumes sales amount is net of tax”).  

**Don’t**
- Don’t cram everything into one giant measure; break it down into helper/base measures.  
- Don’t use `FILTER(ALL(Table), …)` when `REMOVEFILTERS` or `ALLSELECTED` is sufficient.  
- Don’t overuse iterators (`SUMX`, `AVERAGEX`) when a simple aggregator (`SUM`, `AVERAGE`) works.  
- Don’t create calculated columns for context-dependent logic (calculated columns are fixed at refresh).  
- Don’t use `ALL` blindly; it removes filters across the board and may introduce unexpected results.

## Practical Examples

<details>
<summary>Using VAR for clarity</summary>

```DAX
[YoY Sales %] =
VAR _PrevYear =
    CALCULATE (
        [Total Sales],
        DATEADD ( 'Date'[Date], -1, YEAR )
    )
RETURN
    IF (
        _PrevYear = 0,
        BLANK(),
        DIVIDE ( [Total Sales] - _PrevYear, _PrevYear )
    )
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Safe margin calculation</summary>

```DAX
[Margin %] =
VAR _TotalSales = [Total Sales]
VAR _TotalCost  = [Total Cost]
RETURN
    IF (
        _TotalSales = 0,
        BLANK(),
        DIVIDE ( _TotalSales - _TotalCost, _TotalSales )
    )
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Switch instead of nested IF</summary>

```DAX
[Customer Segment] =
SWITCH (
    TRUE(),
    [Customer Spend] > 10000, "High Value",
    [Customer Spend] > 5000,  "Medium Value",
    [Customer Spend] > 0,     "Low Value",
    BLANK()
)
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Remove filters selectively</summary>

```DAX
[Total Sales (Ignore Product)] =
CALCULATE (
    [Total Sales],
    REMOVEFILTERS ( 'Product' )
)
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Iterators vs aggregators</summary>

❌ Less efficient
```DAX
[Total Sales X] =
SUMX ( 'Sales', 'Sales'[Quantity] * 'Sales'[UnitPrice] )
```

✅ Better (when column already exists)
```DAX
[Total Sales] = SUM ( 'Sales'[SalesAmount] )
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Explicit blank handling</summary>

```DAX
[Return Rate %] =
VAR _Returns = [Total Returns]
VAR _Sales   = [Total Sales]
RETURN
    IF (
        ISBLANK ( _Sales ),
        BLANK(),
        DIVIDE ( _Returns, _Sales )
    )
```
