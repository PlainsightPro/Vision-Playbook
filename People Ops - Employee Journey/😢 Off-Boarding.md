# Off-boarding at Plainsight

At Plainsight, saying goodbye to a colleague is never easy. Whether you're moving on to new adventures or taking a different path, we want to ensure your transition is smooth, respectful, and positive. Here’s how we handle the off-boarding process:

## A Warm Goodbye 🌞

We understand that off-boarding is a significant moment for both the departing employee and the team. Our goal is to make sure everything is handled professionally and with care.

### 1. Exit Interview 🗣️
We value your feedback and experiences during your time with us. An exit interview provides an opportunity to share your thoughts on what worked well and areas where we can improve. This conversation is confidential and helps us continue to grow as a company. Besides the official exit interview, you'll have at least one extra feedbackconversation with someone else. This is to ensure both parties capture the correct feedback and can possibly adapt their way of working accordingly. 

### 2. Knowledge Transfer 📚
Before you go, we’ll work with you to ensure a smooth transition of your responsibilities. This includes:
- **Documenting Processes**: Making sure that your knowledge and work are properly documented.
- **Training Successors**: If possible, assisting in training the person who will take over your role.

### 3. Handing Over Company Assets 💻
We’ll coordinate the return of any company assets, such as laptops, access cards, or other equipment. This process is straightforward, and our IT team will assist in managing account access and data transfer securely.

### 4. Celebrating on Your Terms 🎉
While it’s completely optional, we encourage departing team members to consider organizing a farewell drink or gathering if they wish to celebrate their time at Plainsight. This initiative is up to you—whether it's a casual coffee, a drink after work, or any other way you’d like to say goodbye. It’s your moment, so feel free to make it how you want it to be!

### 5. Final Payroll and Benefits 🧾
We’ll ensure that your final paycheck and any outstanding benefits are processed promptly. Our People Team will provide you with all the necessary details regarding your final payment, benefits continuation, and any other important information.

## Staying Connected 🌍

Just because you're leaving Plainsight doesn’t mean you’re leaving our community. We encourage you to stay in touch through our communities and events. See you there!
