That's a lot! Do I need to be the best in all these domains? No, but an olympic minimum and shown expertise is required. 

Do I need to execute all these tasks? No, luckily we are a team where everyone has his expertise. However we need to be able to cover all domains on all offerings to reach success. We expect that in your offering you at least are responsible for one of those domains. That does not mean you need to do all the activities. However it is of course your responsibility that everything is done well where you are responsible for.

That's how a team of people with everyone's strengths can be top notch on all domains to achieve business success.
