# 🛹 Pre-Boarding 
<p align="left"><em>Pre-boarding at Plainsight is all about making sure we're a perfect match.</em></p>
<br>

### Here's how it works:
**🚀 Quick Intro Call**:  

We'll start with a brief chat to introduce ourselves and learn about your background.

**🚀 Face-to-Face Meeting**:  

If the initial vibe is good, we'll invite you to one of our offices for a deeper conversation on the same day.

**🚀 Technical Test**:  

You'll take a technical test to show us your problem-solving skills.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🧘 **Relax**: no prep needed—just bring your own laptop with a Google account, and we'll explain everything on the spot.

**🚀 When in doubt**:

Every single colleague at Plainsight is ready to answer any question or insecurity you might have. Feel free to contact them via LinkedIn and give them a call or chat!


**🚀 Offer and Next Steps**: 

If everything aligns, we'll extend an offer and set up a Teams call to walk you through the details.

**🚀 Decision Time**:  

Once you're happy with the offer, it's time to accept and get ready to join us!

**This streamlined process ensures we're on the same page from the start and ready to move forward together. 🙌**
