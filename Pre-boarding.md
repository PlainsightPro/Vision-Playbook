# 🛹 Pre-Boarding 

_Pre-boarding at Plainsight is all about making sure we're a perfect match 🤝._

### Here's how it works:

🚀 **Quick Intro Call**  
  - We'll start with a brief chat to introduce ourselves and learn about your background.

🚀 **Face-to-Face Meeting**  
  - If the initial vibe is good, we'll invite you to one of our offices for a deeper conversation on the same day.

🚀 **Technical Test**  
  - You'll take a technical test to show us your problem-solving skills.
  - 🧘 **Relax**: No prep needed—just bring your own laptop with a Google account, and we'll explain everything on the spot.

🚀 **When in Doubt**  
  - Every single colleague at Plainsight is ready to answer any question or insecurity you might have. Feel free to contact them via LinkedIn and give them a call or chat!

🚀 **Offer and Next Steps**  
  - If everything aligns, we'll extend an offer and set up a Teams call to walk you through the details.

🚀 **Decision Time**  
  - Once you're happy with the offer, it's time to accept and get ready to join us!

**This streamlined process ensures we're on the same page from the start and ready to move forward together. 🙌**
