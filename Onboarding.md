# 👋 Onboarding: Your Journey with Plainsight Begins

_Onboarding at Plainsight is designed to make you feel welcome, informed, and ready to hit the ground running 🏃‍♂️‍➡️_

Here’s what to expect:

## 🚀 Signing Your Proposal
Before we kick off the onboarding process, you'll need to sign your proposal. This is the first step in officially becoming a part of the Plainsight team.

## 🚀 Onboarding Setup
Once your proposal is signed, we begin preparing for your arrival:

- **HR Contact**: Our HR team will reach out to guide you through the initial steps.
- **HR Platform Access**: You'll receive a link to our [HR Platform](https://selfservice.officient.io), where you'll fill in all the relevant information we need to get everything set before your start date. 
- **Mobility Options**: We’ll give you some information about the mobility options you have at Plainsight. Feel free to already take a peek here: [🚗 Mobility](Mobility.md). But no worries—we’ll explain everything!
- **Event Invitations**: You’ll start receiving invites to our events, and you're welcome to attend even before your official onboarding day.

## 🚀 Onboarding Day
Your first day with us is all about getting you settled and connected:

- **Welcome Kit**: You’ll receive your laptop, mouse, a welcome gift, and some time to set up your laptop according to your preferences.
- **Orientation**: We’ll walk you through everything you need to know — how we work, the tools we use, and where to go when you need help or have questions.
  - We’ll make sure your phone subscription gets transferred to our [Mobile Vikings account](https://mobilevikings.be).
  - You’ll get added to our WhatsApp group.
  - If you chose a company car: you’ll get the keys 🔑.
  - We’ll take your picture for your accounts 📸.
- **Meet the Team**: After covering the essentials, we’ll schedule time for you to meet some of your new colleagues and start building connections.

## 🚀 Plainsight Academy
Every September, we host the Plainsight Academy—a five-week training program designed to kickstart your journey with us:

- **Consultant-Led Trainings**: Our own consultants lead these sessions, sharing their expertise and real-world experience.
- **Soft Skills**: We also bring in external experts for soft skills training, ensuring you’re well-rounded and equipped to succeed.

This onboarding process is crafted to ensure you have all the tools, knowledge, and connections you need to thrive at Plainsight from day one.
