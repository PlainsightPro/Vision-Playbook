## Components of the Build Phase:
- **Business Intelligence (BI)**: Creating data models and dashboards to provide real-time insights and reporting capabilities. This empowers decision-makers to make informed choices based on accurate, up-to-date information.
  
- **Self-Service Analytics**: Enabling users across the organization to interact with data independently. Self-service analytics promotes data democratization, allowing business users to explore and generate insights without relying solely on technical teams.

- **Big Data Engineering**: Building scalable and efficient data pipelines to collect, process, and store large volumes of data. This involves developing data architecture that supports a wide range of data types and volumes, ensuring flexibility and performance.

- **AI & Machine Learning**: Leveraging advanced analytics to develop predictive models, automation, and data-driven decision-making processes. The Build phase includes setting up the infrastructure to support AI/ML algorithms and ensuring that these solutions can be integrated seamlessly into business processes.
### Key Principle: Value-Driven Development 
Whatâ€™s key for us is that **everything we build brings value** to the business context. Every stage during the Build phase is frequently evaluated to ensure that development is heading in the right direction and delivering tangible business benefits. This iterative process allows us to adapt and refine our approach based on feedback, keeping the focus on **value creation.**
### Data Platform & Data Products
In the Build phase, the **Data Platform** serves as the backbone that supports all data products. These data products are tailored to address specific business needs and are designed to be modular and scalable, allowing easy integration with various analytical tools and applications.

### Deliverables:
- A robust data platform to centralize data access and processing.
- Scalable data pipelines for seamless data ingestion and transformation.
- Data products tailored for BI, self-service analytics, big data engineering, and AI/ML use cases.
- Clear documentation and best practices for building, deploying, and maintaining data products.

By establishing a strong foundation with the right data platform and products, the Build phase ensures that organizations have the tools they need to harness their data effectively, laying the groundwork for ongoing support, enhancement, and innovation.
