# Plan Phase: Data Strategy

In the Plan phase, we focus on crafting a tailored data strategy that aligns with the business goals and objectives of our clients. This phase is crucial for understanding the full potential of data within an organization and **setting the foundation** for future data initiatives.

## Steps in the Plan Phase
1. **Discovery**: We engage in a thorough exploration of the clientâ€™s business value chain, capturing various use cases and identifying how data and analytics can drive value across different functions. This includes considering **People, Process, Technology, and Data** as the key pillars to ensure a holistic approach.


3. **Business Prioritization**: To maximize the impact of data initiatives, we evaluate the identified use cases based on two dimensions: **business impact** and **technical feasibility**. This allows us to prioritize opportunities that provide the greatest return on investment while being achievable with the existing or planned capabilities. Sometimes it might be better to opt for a technical less perfect solution, if it fits the business better. Value is key!

4. **Roadmap Execution & Governance**: Once the use cases are prioritized, we develop a clear and actionable roadmap that outlines the phases of execution. This roadmap also includes reference architectures that guide technology implementation, ensuring that each phase contributes to the overall data strategy and organizational goals.

## Deliverables
- Comprehensive use cases tailored to business objectives.
- A roadmap that outlines the sequence of data initiatives for effective implementation.
- A scalable architecture to support current and future data needs.
- A business case for each prioritized use case, providing clear value and expected outcomes.

By focusing on strategic alignment and business impact, the Plan phase sets the groundwork for effective data utilization, ensuring that every step taken contributes to long-term value and growth.
