# Why This Playbook? 🤔

This playbook exists to align everyone with our purpose, values, and processes. We want to show who we are to all our stakeholders—our colleagues, customers, partners, friends, and family, and anyone who wants to know what Plainsight stands for and how we do business. It’s a living document that evolves with us, ensuring that we stay on course as we grow and innovate together.

Principles:

- Guidelines in the handbook are meant to help, not act as strict rules.

- Be gentle when reminding others about guidelines, using phrases like "It’s not a problem, but next time consider this guideline."

- If someone responds with a link to the handbook, they’re trying to help, not expecting you to have read it all.

- When asking for help, document the answer to share with the community and discuss where to document it.

- Always link to the relevant part of the handbook in communications rather than copying text.

- The handbook reflects current practices; to change a process, update the handbook via a merge request.

- Handbook guidelines apply equally to everyone of us.

- Follow #playbook channel for updates.
