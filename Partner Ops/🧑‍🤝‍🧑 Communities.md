## Community Involvement: Sharing Knowledge Beyond Boundaries

At Plainsight, we believe that the best way to grow as data professionals is to actively engage in communities that foster learning, sharing, and collaboration. We are proud to be active participants in two key data communities: **[DataMinds](https://dataminds.be/)** and **[Fabric Belgium](https://powerbi.brussels/)**. Our involvement goes beyond just attending events; we aim to share knowledge, learn from others, and help break down silos between organizations.

### DataMinds
[DataMinds](https://dataminds.be/) is a thriving community that focuses on the Microsoft Data Platform, from data engineering to analytics. By participating in this group, we stay connected with the latest developments in data technology, and we contribute by sharing insights and best practices from our own experiences. The community is a hub for discussions on topics like SQL, Power BI/ Fabric, Azure Data Services, and much more, making it an invaluable resource for anyone in the data space.

Once a year, at the beginning of October, you can find us at the [DataMinds Connect](https://datamindsconnect.be/) Summit - a three-day event bringing together everyone in the data community. 
### Fabric Belgium
[Fabric Belgium](https://powerbi.brussels/) is a focused community that gathers Power BI enthusiasts and professionals in Brussels to exchange ideas, showcase projects, and collaborate on best practices. Our participation in this group allows us to engage in deep-dive discussions about business intelligence, data visualization, and the practical application of Microsoft Fabric & Power BI in various business contexts. We learn from real-world use cases and have the opportunity to share our own insights on building effective, data-driven solutions.

### A Culture of Knowledge Sharing
By being active in these communities, we strive to promote a culture of open knowledge-sharing across organizational boundaries. Our aim is not just to advance our internal expertise, but also to contribute to the wider data community. We believe that the sharing of ideas, challenges, and successes leads to better solutions for all and drives the entire data field forward.

By immersing ourselves in these communities, we aim to stay on the cutting edge of data technology and trends while contributing to the overall growth and development of the data landscape.
